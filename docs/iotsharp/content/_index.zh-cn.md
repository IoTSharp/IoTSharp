# IotSharp

[IotSharp](http://github.com/iotsharp/IotSharp) is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static website engine written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this multilingual-ready theme is **fully designed for documentation**.

This theme is a partial porting of the [Learn theme](http://learn.getgrav.org/) of [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), a modern flat-file CMS written in PHP.
